Identifying objects in an image. An image is received.

One or more salient objects in the image is identified, based on execution of a saliency algorithm. A generic location for the image is determined, based on the one or more identified salient objects and a database that associates objects with generic locations. One or more of the unidentified objects are identified, based on the determined generic location for the image.
