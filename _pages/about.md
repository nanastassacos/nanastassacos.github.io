I am currently doing a PhD in Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning and its applications to Social Systems at UCL. I am co-supervised by Prof. Mirco Musolesi and Prof. Steve Hailes and am part of the Autonomous Agents lab. My PhD is funded by the Alan Turing Institute where, up until recently, I spent most of my time. 

I graduated from The University of Edinburgh with a BSc in Computational Cognitive Science in 2016 and then from University College London with an MSc in Data Science and Machine Learning in 2017.

Research Interests.
======
My research has focused primarily on the emergence of cooperation drawing inspiration from work done in the evolutionary biology commmunity. In particular, I have been looking at mechanisms that are present in societies that promote cooperative behaviours between self-interested agents. These mechanisms include partner selection and reputation dynamics. In my PhD, I look to analyse how these mechanisms contribute to the development of certain behaviours and strategies using reinforcement learning agents that make decisions based on data.


While my focus has been primarily on emergent behaviours using reinforcement learning, I am also deeply interested in model-based reinforcement learning and how to have good performance models outside of simulation. I am hopeful that the work I do can contribute to developing solutions for critical issues in sectors like mass migration and climate change.
